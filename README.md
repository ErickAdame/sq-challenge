# sq-challenge
Demonstrate data modeling, data engineering and data analysis using SQL queries

#This repo contains all the data in a directory named DATA. There are six CSV files with simulated employee data.

#I have designed six tables to hold the data from the CSV files. A series of queries answer questions about the employee database by joining various tables.

#SQL files with table/schemata and queries are located in directory named "EmployeeSQL". 

#There is also an ERD located in the "EmployeeSQL" directory.
